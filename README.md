Let $G$ be infinite, connected, locally finite, quasi-transitive, unimodular, non-amenable, Gromov hyperbolic with one end.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Connected, locally finite} : there exists a non-trivial phase transition and the hyperbolic boundary will be a compact metric space.
\item \textbf{Quasi-transitive, unimodular} : extension from cayley graphs of groups. q-t in the unimodular context is transitive with a random root. Moreover, the non-unimodular case has been resolved.
\item \textbf{Non-amenable}: the existence of the infinite phase can only happen in the non-amenable case.
\item \textbf{Gromov hyperbolic}: geometric condition that extends trees.
\item \textbf{One end}: to ensure the non-triviality of the uniqueness phase.
\end{itemize}
